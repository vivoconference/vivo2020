#### VIVO 2020 Call for Proposals is now open!
##### Present your work and ideas at VIVO 2020

Do you help make scholarly data open, found, and consumed? Do you have fresh ideas or new work you want to share with us? We’d love to hear from you! The VIVO conference covers a broad range of topics surrounding research information systems. VIVO 2020 will be an online, virtual conference, which leads to some new formats. We encourage submissions from people who are new to the VIVO community, and formats that work well online.

##### Possible formats

We are planning two session lengths:
* presentations (20 minutes)
* lightning talks (6 minutes)

Your presentation or lightning talk may take the form of a demonstration (screen share in Zoom), a panel discussion, an interview, a virtual poster (single slide), a brainstorming session, an interactive survey session, or other.

##### Proposal and review process

1. ~~**Before May 15, 2020:**~~ **EXTENDED DEADLINE: Before May, 2020** [Share your proposal through OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=vivoconference.org/VIVO/2020/Conference), where it will be publicly visible. The proposal should be submitted as an abstract of 150 - 350 words.
2. Share the OpenReview link of your proposal on social media and your networks, and invite people to comment and engage.
3. Keep an eye on the interactions, and reply when meaningful.
4. **Between the date of submission and May 22:** Assigned reviewers start posting reviews from 15 May until May 31; they will become visible immediately and you can react to them. 
5. **On May 25:** You are notified about acceptance.
6. Between 1 June and 9 June the VIVO Conference task force members decide on the final program.  The program will be available on the conference web site June 9.

##### Archiving and DOI

The VIVO conference requires that your work be publically available from a repository of your choice.  Your repository must assign your work a DOI and must make your work open and freely available to all.  We recommend your work be licensed using a Creative Commons license. Repositories that provide that will allow you to satisfy these requirements include figshare and Zenodo.
