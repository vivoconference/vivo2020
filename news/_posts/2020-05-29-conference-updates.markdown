#### Keynote and EuroCRIS news

Are you planning to attend the 11th international VIVO conference? Don’t wait. [Register now!!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2020-vivo-conference-tickets-97993221363)

We are finishing the review of the many really interesting proposals submitted by the international community.

We are proud to have [Dr. Mathias Brochhausen](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/brochhausen-mathias-1/) as keynote speaker. Dr. Brochhausen is Associate Director of Education Programs and Associate Professor, in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics at the University of Florida.  Dr. Brochhausen’s research focuses on ontology and the representation of social constructs.

And we are excited to continue our collaboration with [euroCRIS](https://www.eurocris.org/) with a session titled:

*“VIVO in the euroCRIS Directory of Research Information Systems (DRIS): a growing presence, multiple use cases”*

>Taking the in-progress euroCRIS DRIS as a starting point, the session will feature an introductory presentation by a euroCRIS representative exploring the geographic distribution and the various configurations for the VIVO implementations listed in the directory. A number of case study presentations will follow featuring the two main settings for VIVO systems in Europe: as standalone CRIS systems and as research portals on top of an underlying 'monolithic' CRIS. A round table with the presenters will close the session in which various VIVO configuration issues will be discussed.

These and more engaging presentations will come soon in the program! You cannot miss it!
